## TODO

### Flow

Features:

- Figure out likely running location (Sherman Branch, Veteran's Park, etc.) computed from GPS track
    - Geohash 7 chars
    - Refer to Gemini chat about how to download local park data boundaries and convert to geohash set
    - Precompute set of geohashed trackpoints for run
    - Find the park with the most overlap between park geohashes and run trackpoint geohashes
- Heatmap: Make a histogram grid of run trackpoint geohashes. Probably a library for this.
- Calendar view: Simple calendar month view with run days circled. Tapping a day takes you to the runs for that day.
- Heart rate stats:
    - Custom calculation of zones based on highest heart rate ever recorded
    - % of time in each zone

## TODO later
